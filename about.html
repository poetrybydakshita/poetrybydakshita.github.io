  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m Dakshita Dhingra — a writer, poet, and author who believes that
    emotions deserve honest words. I’ve been writing for over seven years,
    turning feelings, stories, and moments into poetry and meaningful writing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through <strong>Poetry by Dakshita</strong>, I offer writing services,
    freelancing, and customised poetry crafted from real emotions — for those
    who feel deeply but struggle to express it.
