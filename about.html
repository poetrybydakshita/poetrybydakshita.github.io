<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
Hi, I’m Dakshita Dhingra — a writer, poet, and storyteller who believes that emotions deserve honest words.
I’ve spent years turning feelings, memories, and unspoken thoughts into poetry and prose that people can
feel, not just read.
</p>

<p>
Writing became my way of understanding the world — of loving deeply, fighting quietly, and healing softly.
Through <strong>Poetry by Dakshita</strong>, I create personalised poetry, meaningful words, and creative writing
that holds space for real emotions.
</p>

<p>
Whether it’s love, loss, hope, or becoming — my work is for those who feel deeply but struggle to explain it.
If words matter to you, you’re in the right place.
</p>
